Description: Python processing code for 3D images taken with the VP SEM. 

Information: 
Designed to run in Enthought Canopy. All scripts have to be run in the same folder with source files. I.e. you have to "cd" to the proper folder like 8-11-2013/297_3d_snp7/csvs/ and then run the code. Files are generally outputted into the same folder. 

Coding style:
  * own functions in camelCase
  * variables in underscore_manner
  * every function should have a DOCSTRING (and explain unclear returns)
  * upholding the PEP8 standard if possible
    * validator here: http://pep8online.com/checkresult
